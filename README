NAME
    AnyEvent::Server::PSGI::Twiggy - AnyEvent HTTP server for PSGI (like
    Thin)

SYNOPSIS
      use AnyEvent::Server::PSGI::Twiggy;

      my $server = AnyEvent::Server::PSGI::Twiggy->new(
          host => $host,
          port => $port,
      );
      $server->register_service($app);

      AE::cv->recv;

DESCRIPTION
    AnyEvent::Server::PSGI::Twiggy is a lightweight and fast HTTP server
    with unique features such as:

    PSGI
        Can run any PSGI applications. Fully supports *psgi.nonblocking* and
        *psgi.streaming* interfaces.

    AnyEvent
        This server uses AnyEvent and runs in a non-blocking event loop, so
        it's best to run event-driven web applications that runs I/O bound
        jobs or delayed responses such as long-poll, WebSocket or streaming
        content (server push).

    Fast header parser
        Uses XS/C based HTTP header parser for the best performance.

    Lightweight and Fast
        The memory required to run twiggy is 6MB and it can serve more than
        4000 req/s with a single process on Perl 5.10 with MacBook Pro 13"
        late 2009.

TWIGGY?
    Because it is like <Thin>, Ruby's Rack web server using EventMachine.
